    "content": "Elena had been an apprentice to the village herbalist for three years when she first heard the whispers. They came on nights when the wind howled through the mountain passes, carrying with it a sound that was almost like breathing-deep, slow, and impossibly ancient.\n\nDon't go to the Forgotten Mountain, her master warned, his weathered hands trembling as he ground medicinal herbs. The old ones say a dragon sleeps there, and its dreams keep the darkness at bay.\n\nBut when a shadow began creeping across the land, withering crops and turning the sky gray, Elena knew she had no choice. The village elders spoke in hushed tones of an ancient prophecy-that only the dragon's fire could drive back the encroaching void.\n\nThe climb took two days. Elena's fingers were raw and bleeding by the time she reached the summit, where a cave mouth yawned like a wound in the mountainside. Inside, the air shimmered with residual magic, and there, coiled in impossible spirals of sapphire and gold, lay the dragon."
