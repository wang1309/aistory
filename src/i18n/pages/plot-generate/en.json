        {
          "title": "How can I improve the quality of the story generated by a plot generator?",
          "description": "To improve quality: provide clear and detailed prompts (genre, character motivations, setting, conflict); treat the generated output as a starting point and revise it with your unique voice and details; experiment with different prompt variations to discover more original ideas."

        {
          "title": "What is the difference between an AI plot generator and a traditional plot generator?",

          "title": "Is it okay to use the output of a plot generator for commercial publishing?",
          "description": "While you can use the generated outline as a starting point, it's strongly recommended to revise and add originality — develop characters, settings, and voice further. Check the tool's terms of use and verify rights/copyright before using for commercial purposes."
        },
        {
          "title": "How can a plot generator help when I'm stuck in my story structure?",
          "description": "When you're stuck, a plot generator can provide a sequence of key story beats (beginning → middle → climax → resolution), suggest character roles and motivations, propose conflict/turnaround moments, and spark ideas you might not have considered."

        {
          "title": "What are common mistakes when using a plot generator and how to avoid them?",
          "description": "Common mistakes: using generated content without revision (results may feel templated), inputting too vague prompts (leading to generic output), neglecting deeper character/world development, ignoring your target audience or genre expectations. To avoid them, refine your prompt, personalise the output, and align it to your audience."
